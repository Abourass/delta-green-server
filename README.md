> A (fictional) Delta Green BBS

### ✨ [Demo (User: `newAgent`, Pass: `***`)](https://elegant-jang-3eefb2.netlify.app/)

I made this as prop for my Delta Green game, and figured I'd share. If you want to run your own version, simply for this repo, then in your repo change `/src/Agents.ts` to add give players custom logins.

To deploy quickly I recommend Netlify!
